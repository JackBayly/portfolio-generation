                I am an English as a second language teacher looking to transition into web development. I have been
                self-studying front-end web development for the past year using online programming curriculums such as
                FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. I have also recently graduated from a web development boot camp with
                the organization Generation USA.

        <div id="experience">
            I knew I wanted to one day get into tech as a professional, specifically in web development, since I took my
            first technical writing course at Georgia State University and was exposed to HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript. I
            later worked as a technical writing intern during my senior year. <br><br> While I eventually went on to
            teach English as a foreign language in Spain, my passion is in tech, which is why I moved back to Atlanta,
            one of the major tech hub cities in America and my hometown. I'm a proud optimist and more than eager to
            learn new technologies. If that sounds like someone you'd want to work with as a junior developer, feel free
            to reach out!
