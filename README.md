<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>This is definitely a first draft for my portfolio. It is very MVP. However, I am excited to add to it and improve it as my skillset grows. I would like to make it responsive on mobile and add thumbnails to the project cards, among other things. I think it's a good first draft and it was fun making it.</p>
